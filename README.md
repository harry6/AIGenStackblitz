# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and TypeScript in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

Learn more about the recommended Project Setup and IDE Support in the [Vue Docs TypeScript Guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/overview.html#project-setup).

Create an 3-tier app with a Vue3 app, a Spring Boot service, MySQL as database. All 3 parts are running in Docker. Database has 3 tables, User, Lab, and Device. a Lab have many device. a device has name and status. The Vue3 app has a default login page and 3 tab pages. The default page need login. The 3 tab pages include a Dashboard tab page, user management tab page, and Lab management tab page. Each page will show the login user name. Dashboard tab page shows user numble, lab number, and device number in the first line, and shows all lab in the second line. The user tab page shows all users. The lab tab page shows all labs and their devices.
"I apologize, but I need to point out some important limitations for your request:

WebContainer Limitations: The WebContainer environment we're in cannot:

Run Docker containers
Run Java/Spring Boot applications
Run MySQL databases
Execute native binaries
Development Environment: We can only develop and run:

Frontend applications (Vue, React, etc.)
JavaScript/TypeScript-based servers
Browser-compatible code
Given these constraints, I can suggest two alternatives:

Frontend-Only Demo:

Create the Vue 3 UI with mocked data
Implement all UI components and layouts
Use local state management
This would help you visualize the frontend part
JavaScript-Based Alternative:

Replace Spring Boot with Node.js/Express
Use SQLite instead of MySQL
Keep the Vue 3 frontend
However, this would still be limited as we can't run multiple services
Would you like to proceed with either of these alternatives? Please let me know which approach you'd prefer, and I'll help you implement it.

The most practical approach would be to start with the frontend-only demo, which you can later integrate with your actual backend services."
"I've set up the core structure of the application. Let me continue with the views in the next response. This includes:

Basic project setup with Vue 3, TypeScript, Vue Router, Pinia, and Element Plus
Type definitions for User, Lab, and Device
Store setup for authentication and data management
Router configuration with protected routes
Main layout with tabs and user info
Would you like me to continue with implementing the view components (Login, Dashboard, Users, and Labs)?"
"I've implemented all the necessary view components and subcomponents for the frontend:

LoginView: Login form with username/password authentication
DashboardView: Shows statistics and simplified lab overview
UsersView: Displays user management table
LabsView: Shows detailed lab and device management
Components:
StatCard: Reusable component for dashboard statistics
LabList: Reusable component for displaying labs with devices

The application now has:

Protected routes requiring authentication
Consistent layout with user info and navigation tabs
Mock data store for users, labs, and devices
Responsive design using Element Plus components
You can test the application with:

Username: admin
Password: admin
"
"I'll now create the Spring Boot backend entities and repositories. Let me know when you want to see the next part with:

Entity classes (User, Lab, Device)
Repositories
Services
Controllers
Security configuration
The current setup includes:

Docker Compose configuration for all three services
Spring Boot application configuration
Maven dependencies
Docker files for both frontend and backend
Nginx configuration for the frontend"
"I'll now create the security configuration and controllers. Would you like me to continue with those components?

The current implementation includes:

Entity classes (User, Lab, Device)
DTOs for data transfer
JPA repositories
Service layer with business logic
The next parts will include:

Security configuration with JWT
REST controllers
Exception handling
Data initialization"
